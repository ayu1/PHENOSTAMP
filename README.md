# PHENOSTAMP

I reformatted the PHENOSTAMP code to be run via several functions in a markdown file format. This allows the user to control more aspects of the PHENOSTAMP pipeline and have a proper place to format their own data. 

Original code is sourced from: https://github.com/anchangben/PHENOSTAMP. _stamp_visualize.R_ and _stamp_compute.R_ have been slightly modified.

Data from markdown tutorial is from Karacosta et al. Nat Comm (2020)
