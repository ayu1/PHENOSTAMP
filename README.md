# PHENOSTAMP

I reformatted the PHENOSTAMP code to be run via several functions in a markdwon file format. 

Original code is sourced from: https://github.com/anchangben/PHENOSTAMP. stamp_visualize.R and stamp_compute.R have been slightly modified.

Data from markdown tutorial is from Karacosta et al. Nat Comm (2020)
